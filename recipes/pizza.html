    <h3>Instructions for making a great pizza!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, add 1/2 cup of warm water and the active dry yeast. Set the yeast aside for 5 minutes until it gets foamy. In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients together and knead the dough until when poked, the dough springs back. Add additional flour if the dough is to sticky!</li>
        <li>Set the dough aside in a warm place covered completely with a tea towel or plate.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rise until double size about 5-7 hours (If you have time, I would allow the dough to rise overnight in the fridge)</li>
        <li>When the dough has double in size. Punch the dough until it deflates place in a floured clean surface. Cut the dough in 4 or 5 parts.</li>
        <li>Knead each dough ball for 1 minute and place on a floured rectangle baking sheet and cover with a tea towel. Set the dough aside and allow for another rise until the dough doubles in size about 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Once the doughs doubled in size, preheat oven to the highest 500 tp 550 degrees. During this time, you can prepare all your pizza toppings and sauce.</li>
        <li>When ready to bake, place the pizza stone in the oven and allow to heat up. Roll out the dough thinly on a floured pizza peel and add your sauce and toppings.</li>
        <li>Using the pizza peel, slide the pizza onto the pizza stone in the oven and allow to bake for 7-10 minutes until it bakes to your desired crispness. Enjoy the pizza warm!</li>
